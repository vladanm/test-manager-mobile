# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Electron desktop application that displays a simple "Hello World" interface. The project structure is extremely basic with only the essential files needed for an Electron app.

## Development Commands

- `npm start` - Run the Electron application in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Run the Electron application in development mode (sets NODE_ENV=development)
- `npm run build` - Build the application using electron-builder
- `npm run dist` - Build and package the application without publishing

## Architecture

The application follows the minimal Electron architecture pattern:
- `main.js` - Main process entry point (currently just logs "Hello from Electron ðŸ‘‹")  
- `index.html` - Renderer process HTML file with basic "Hello from Electron renderer!" content
- `package.json` - Project configuration with Electron as the only dependency

## Key Notes

- This is a CommonJS project (`"type": "commonjs"`)
- No testing framework is configured
- No linting or code formatting tools are set up
- No build configuration beyond basic electron-builder usage
- The main.js file is incomplete - it only logs a message and doesn't actually create an Electron window
- Content Security Policy is configured in the HTML file for basic security
